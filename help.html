<p>If you're a developer or software programmer, you're probably no stranger to some of the most common programming languages such as C, Python or Java, or at least understand some things about them.
<br><br>
Another thing that you're most likely familiar with is the concept of IDE, which stands for Integrated Development Environment and can help you simplify the work done on your projects by a great deal, in some cases.
</p>
<h3>Visual IDE</h3>
<p><b>Dragme IDE</b> is a visual-based environment that can help you create various programs in C languages by using blocks, visual elements that can be easily dragged and dropped on your screen, and also modified according to your needs.
<br><br>
The application starts in a splash-screen-like manner that lets you start the IDE, then open it in your browser or exit the app altogether. It is worth noting that you need to have Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer in order for this IDE to run properly.</p>

<h3>Develop C projects and run them</h3>
<p>Once you launch the IDE in your browser, you'll notice that the main screen is divided into four categories: "Blocks," "Code," "Load" and "Help." The "Blocks" section lets you access a collection of blocks that you can develop applications with. The category names are Control, Input/output, Logic, Loops, Math, Variables and Text, and are rather intuitive for experienced programmers.
<br><br>
It has two option : Playground and Codeground. Playground provides you facility to develop application using drag and drop feature. Codeground gives you source code editor, which can be used to write own source code and develop application.
<br><br>
If you're still learning, you can access the "Code" section of the application and observe how the blocks you add to your project influence the end product. More so, it is possible to choose from a bunch of sample applications by opening the "Load" menu and choosing your favorite one from the list.</p>

<h3>Handy IDE that lets you develop apps by using blocks</h3>
<p>All in all, if you're interested in developing C language applications in a visual manner by using blocks that you can drag and drop freely, you might want to check Dragme IDE out. It can be easily installed, packs a simple interface and encompasses intuitive commands.</p>
